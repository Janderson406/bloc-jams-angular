 //The play method takes an argument, song, which we'll get from the Album view when
 //a user clicks the play button; the ngRepeat directive used in the Album view template will
 //dictate which song to pass into the function. The play method creates a new Buzz object
 //using the song's audioUrl property and then calls Buzz's own  play method on the object.
